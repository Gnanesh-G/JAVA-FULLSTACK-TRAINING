Today Learning: 09/11/2023(Java Full Stack Training -Day 35)
Today first we completed the yesterday's Spring task and added in the github with Readme file
Then started to learn about Spring Jpa entity.
Created a new project ant try a toodo application with jpa.
 
 JPA Entity:
 Entities in JPA are nothing but POJOs representing data that can be persisted in the database.
 An entity represents a table stored in a database. Every instance of an entity represents a row in the table.
  
Steps used to build a application with Jpa:
ðŸ‘‰ Added the required maven dependencies (Data-jdbc,Data-jpa).
ðŸ‘‰ Connected Database for storing and accessing data.
ðŸ‘‰ Used MVC (Model, View, Controller) Architecture.
ðŸ‘‰ Used annotations like @Controller, @RequestMapping, @Autowired,@Entity,@Named query,
    @Id,@Generated value.
