Today first we completed the yesterday's Spring MVC task and added in the github with Readme file
Then trainer give the explanation about final project.
Then started to learn about Springboot with rest API.
In that I done a CRUD application called Springboot todo with API.

Explanation about the CRUD application:
---------------------------------------
Intro:
This is a simple ToDo application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. 
The application is built using Spring for the backend and Angular for the frontend.

Technologies Used:
Spring Boot
Angular
MySQL Database

API Endpoints:
The backend API endpoints are accessible at http://localhost:8080/api/todos.
You can use tools like Postman to interact with the API.

Steps used to build this application:
ðŸ‘‰ Added the required maven dependencies (SQL, Servlet, JSTL, Spring).
ðŸ‘‰ Connected Database for storing and accessing data.
ðŸ‘‰ Used MVC (Model, View, Controller) Architecture.
ðŸ‘‰ Used annotations like @Controller, @RequestMapping, @Autowired.
ðŸ‘‰ Used Data Access Object (dao) for accessing Database using queries.
