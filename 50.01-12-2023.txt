        Topics covered:
        ---------------

        *Custom validation
            Custom async validators are similar to sync validators,
            but they must instead return a Promise or observable that later emits null or a validation error object.
        
        *Lazy loading:
         Lazy loading in angular is the process of loading website components, modules, or other assets when they are needed.

        *Struct:
          Nesting storing and sorting in struct in angular.
          so I have a JSON file with lots of information that can be sorted many ways.
